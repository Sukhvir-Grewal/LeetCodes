# Version 1.0.0

I just learned the Version naming, So just Let's talk about it first. There are many kinds of way to represent a person of a system but the most used one is X.Y.Z

1. **X** : The major version
2. **Y** : The minor version
3. **Z**  : The patch version 

Alright so now we know about the version system let's talk about our first problem on this GitHub depository
